## Overview

**HomeRide** is a comprehensive, full-stack web platform designed to facilitate carpooling exclusively for employees within an organization.  
Developed as an internship project at **Sopra Steria**, this application connects employees to share rides, creating a community-driven solution to commuting.

The platform empowers employees to offer their empty car seats or find rides with trusted colleagues, achieving three primary goals:

* **üí∏ Save Money:** Reduces commuting costs by up to 75% by sharing fuel and toll expenses.  
* **üåç Go Green:** Lowers the organization's carbon footprint, saving an average of 2.5kg of CO‚ÇÇ per shared trip.  
* **ü§ù Build Community:** Fosters networking and strengthens workplace connections during commutes.

The backend is built with **Java Spring Boot** and deployed on **Render**, while the frontend is a modern **React SPA** deployed on **Vercel**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. User Authentication & Profiles
* **Secure Authentication:** Robust JWT-based authentication and authorization using Spring Security.  
* **Role-Based Access:** Differentiated access levels for `EMPLOYEE` and `ADMIN` roles.  
* **Comprehensive User Profiles:** Detailed user profiles displaying name, contact info, profile picture (hosted on Cloudinary), average rating, and full history of feedback and rides.

### 2. Ride Lifecycle Management
* **Offer a Ride:** An intuitive multi-step form allows drivers to post rides, specify origin, destination, and multiple stopovers using the **Google Places Autocomplete API**.  
* **Vehicle & Price Settings:** Drivers can set vehicle details, seat capacity, gender preferences, and a price per seat. The system provides a recommended price based on route distance.  
* **Advanced Ride Search:** Passengers can search for rides filtering by origin, destination, date, and available seats.  
* **Interactive Booking:** Ride detail pages include an interactive **Google Map** showing the full route and stopovers, transparent pricing, and participant info.  
* **"My Rides" Dashboard:** A central dashboard for users to manage their upcoming and completed rides as both driver and passenger.

### 3. Communication & Trust
* **Real-time Ride Chat:** A WebSocket-based group chat (SockJS & STOMP) enables real-time coordination between driver and passengers.  
* **Rating & Feedback System:** After a ride, participants can rate and leave feedback for one another to build trust.

### 4. Admin & Platform Features
* **Admin Dashboard:** A dedicated `/admin` panel provides platform statistics like total users and total rides.  
* **Employee Management:** Admins can view all employees, roles, ride history, and manage user details.  
* **AI Chatbot (GOGO):** Integrated AI assistant powered by **Google Gemini API** for platform support and FAQs.  
* **Email & In-App Notifications:** Uses **SendGrid** and in-app alerts to notify users about bookings, messages, and feedback.  
* **Analytics:** User behavior and usage are tracked using **Google Analytics 4** (`react-ga4`).

The platform follows a modern three-tier distributed architecture:

* **Frontend (Client Layer):** Responsive **React SPA**, deployed on **Vercel‚Äôs CDN** for optimal performance.  
* **Backend (API Layer):** Stateless **Spring Boot API** on **Render**, managing business logic and API integrations, secured with JWT.  
* **Data & Services Layer:**  
  - **Database:** **PostgreSQL** on Render, storing users, rides, and bookings.  
  - **Real-time Chat:** **WebSocket** endpoint on the backend.  
  - **External APIs:**  
    - **Google Maps & Places** ‚Äì geocoding, distance, and autocomplete.  
    - **Cloudinary** ‚Äì image storage and CDN delivery.  
    - **SendGrid** ‚Äì transactional emails.  
    - **Google Gemini** ‚Äì AI chatbot integration.
